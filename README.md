# CAFFEINE
Collaorative Affordable Framework For Experiments In Networked Electronics

[README IN PROGRESS]

CAFFEINE is a mixed hardware/software framework that enables real-time low-latency sonification of sensor data from wearable embedded systems. The framework utilizes a many-to-many network topology, allowing unlimited pods and clients, constrained only by hardware availability. Wireless, battery-powered pods, built around the ESP32 microcontroller platform, host sensor arrays that capture diverse data, including motion, sound, distance, and light. Data are transmitted to a broker program that routes them to registered clients for sonification or further processing. CAFFEINE prioritizes accessibility and affordability, designed for artists and musicians with minimal technical expertise. Its extensible architecture supports creative applications, from live movement sonification to environmental data-driven compositions, reducing barriers to networked sensor technologies.
